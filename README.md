Rusty Calculator
================

Rusty Calculator is a small desktop calculator (for Windows) that can sit nicely on your taskbar and be called when needed. It's very nice.

Use
===

When you launch Rusty, a calculator icon will appear in your taskbar. If you like to keep Rusty there, you can put a shortcut to it in your startup folder.

To use Rusty, click that icon and type in an equation, then hit enter. The answer will pop up in a white box.

You can expand that white box by clicking on it. This allows you to see the expression and answer in full form. You can even edit the expression and press ctrl + enter to re-evaluate it.

If you right-click on the white box, you'll have options to copy the expression or delete it.

In the future
=============

In the future I want to save the state of the calculator between sessions, and I want to hook up the 'calc' key on my Dell to open it up.

FAQ

###Why "Rusty"?

I named it after my university's prized [giant ground sloth](https://www.facebook.com/rustythegiantsloth).
